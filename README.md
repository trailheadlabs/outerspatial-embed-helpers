# OuterSpatial Embed Helpers

## Scripts

- `load-builder-map.js`: Checks for the presence of a `window.OuterSpatialEmbedHelpers` object with `builderMapId` and `element` properties and loads a Builder map from OuterSpatial
- `parent-cross-origin.js`: Adds support for [OuterSpatial Map Library](https://github.com/trailheadlabs/outerspatial-map-library/)'s fullscreen and hash controls to a map that's embedded in an iframe in a web page hosted outside the outerspatial.com domain
